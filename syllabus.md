# Intro to bioinformatics

Welcome to Intro to bioinformatics! We're going to have a great time this semester exploring bioinformatics together.
I am a seasoned bioinformatician working at CDC, and I have had my footprint in _Neisseria_, _Vibrio_, _Listeria_, _Escherichia_, _Salmonella_, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and many other pathogens.
Working at CDC is my full time job, and it is my honor to work with you after hours in this course.
I am excited to introduce you to the marvelous world of bioinformatics and infectious diseases.

# Course outcomes

# Week by week

Please note that this conveys a plan for the semester.
Some deviations may be necessary as the semester progresses.

1. Intro to this course
