# Intro to bioinformatics

Welcome to Intro to bioinformatics! We're going to have a great time this semester exploring bioinformatics together.
I am your instructor, Dr. Lee Katz.
I am a seasoned bioinformatician working at CDC, and I have had my footprint in _Neisseria_, _Vibrio_, _Listeria_, _Escherichia_, _Salmonella_, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and many other pathogens.
Working at CDC is my full time job, and it is my honor to work with you after hours in this course.
I am excited to introduce you to the marvelous world of bioinformatics and infectious diseases.

# Course outcomes

Everyone in bioinformatics struggles to define bioinformatics itself.
I personally believe it is because it is such a new and diverse field.
Someone who works on computers in physics is a physicist; someone who works on computers in mathematics is a mathematician;
however, someone in biology who works on computers is a bioinformatician.
I can only come to these two conclusions: 1) over time, bioinformatics as a field will be absorbed by molecular biology and 2) bioinformatics is a necessary skill for future molecular biologists.

I know that is probably too much to take in right away and so I'd like to start again.
Bioinformatics is an intersection between statistics, molecular biology, and computer science.
Learning bioinformatics will have different meanings depending on your background.
Advancing yourself in all three of these fields will aid in your success.
However, many other skills will help you here, and so success can also come in the forms of learning other related skills.

In addition to bioinformatics, this course will also touch on how bioinformatics can aid in the study of infectious diseases.
This will help give real life meaning to these academic excercises and will help you get real career skills in bioinformatics.

# Email

Please use your student emails to contact me.
This will help me understand who is contacting me and that it pertains to the course.
I am not at my email at all times of the day and so please allow me 24 hours to respond.
However, I will do my best to answer as soon as possible.

# Grading

Grades will be determined by attendance in the lectures and by success in the workshops.
At this point in your university career, I have to assume you are here because you want to be
and so I want to encourage you to keep showing up.

* Attendance (50%): Will be captured at 5-10 minutes after class start; if necessary, it will also be captured at the end of class.
* Workshops (40%): Workshops will be held for approximately half of our sessions. The results of your workshops will be graded. The TA may also take part in grading.
* Final exam (10%): A final exam will be given and will be open book, open Internet. You may discuss with your classmates.

Final grades will be assigned according to the scale below:  
A+ 	96.5-100%  
A	90.5-96.49%  
A-	89.0-90.49%  
B+	86.5-88.99%  
B	80.5-86.49%  
B-	79.0 – 80.49%  
C+	76.5 – 78.99%  
C	70.5-76.49%  
C-	69.0 – 70.49%  
D	60-68.99%  
F	below 60%  

Do not ask us to give you extra credit or drop assignments.  The grade you receive will be based on your performance on all assignments over the course of the semester.  

# Class honesty policy

In this class I will adhere to the University Academic Honesty Policy with the additions below. You will need to copy and paste this link in your web browser to view it https://deanofstudents.gsu.edu/faculty-staff-resources/academic-honesty/:

Graded Assessments:  The student will receive a zero (0) grade on any quiz or test where there is reasonable evidence for cheating. In addition, a report of academic dishonesty will be submitted to the dean’s office.

During any in-class quiz or test there will be no: talking, looking at others’ papers, using cell phones/texting, using iPods or other devices with headphones, using calculators, using any other electronic devices.  Desks will be clear of all materials except for the exam and a pen/pencil.

Critical Thinking Homework Assignments:  The student will receive a zero (0) grade on the project if there is evidence of plagiarism, or other violation of the university academic honesty policy (see website above).  In addition, a report of academic dishonesty will be submitted to the dean’s office. 

Plagiarism consists of:  using another person’s words/statements/ideas without quoting, referencing or citing; submitting work done by another person; copy/pasting  words/sentences/statements from the internet without quoting/referencing/citing.  For  more information about what plagiarism is and how to avoid it, please visit: www.plagiarism.org  or http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/589/01/ Even the most well-intentioned student can plagiarize because of an incomplete understanding of how to quote or cite/reference. Educate yourself and avoid this!

Unauthorized Collaboration:  Each student is to turn in their own original work.  If it is determined that the submission was written wholly, or in part, by someone other than the student, it will be given a 0 grade and reported to the dean’s office.  

Multiple Submission:  Each submission in this class is to be a new work.  The student may not submit the same work in multiple classes (unless given explicit permission by the instructor).

# Student evaluations

Your constructive assessment of this course plays an indispensable role in shaping education at Georgia State. Upon completing the course, please take time to fill out the online course evaluation.

# Students with Disabilities.

Students who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the Office of Disability Services. Students may only be accommodated upon issuance by the Office of Disability Services of a signed Accommodation Plan and are responsible for providing a copy of that plan to instructors of all classes in which accommodations are sought.

# Week by week

Please note that this conveys a plan for the semester.
Some deviations may be necessary as the semester progresses.
